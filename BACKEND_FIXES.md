# Backend Fixes for Frontend Issues

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Product Images Not Showing**
- **Problem**: Product images were not displaying correctly in order details
- **Fix**: Added proper image URL handling with try-catch blocks in `get_order_history` and `get_order_detail` APIs
- **Code**: Enhanced image URL generation with `request.build_absolute_uri()`

### 2. **Product Names Missing**
- **Problem**: Product names and details were not showing properly
- **Fix**: Added complete product information including `name`, `title`, `brand` in order responses
- **Code**: Enhanced product data structure in order APIs

### 3. **Dynamic Payment Status**
- **Problem**: Payment status was not dynamic based on payment method
- **Fix**: Implemented dynamic payment status logic:
  - **COD**: `pending` until delivered, then `paid`
  - **Online Payment**: `paid` if completed, `pending` otherwise
- **Code**: Added payment status calculation in order APIs

### 4. **Shipping Address Missing**
- **Problem**: Complete shipping address was not showing
- **Fix**: Added full address details including:
  - Name, phone, address, locality, city, state, pincode
  - Full formatted address string
- **Code**: Enhanced address object in order responses

### 5. **Expected Delivery Date**
- **Problem**: Expected delivery date was missing
- **Fix**: Added automatic calculation of delivery date (5 days from order creation)
- **Code**: Set `estimated_delivery` in order creation and tracking

### 6. **Order Cancellation**
- **Problem**: Order cancellation was not working properly
- **Fix**: Enhanced cancel order functionality with:
  - Better validation (can't cancel delivered/out for delivery orders)
  - Proper refund handling based on payment method
  - Clear success/error messages
- **Code**: Improved `cancel_order` API with comprehensive error handling

### 7. **Invoice Download**
- **Problem**: Invoice download was missing
- **Fix**: Added new invoice download endpoint
- **URL**: `GET /api/orders/{order_id}/invoice/`
- **Code**: Returns JSON invoice data with all order details

## New API Endpoints

### Invoice Download
```
GET /api/orders/{order_id}/invoice/
```
Returns complete invoice data in JSON format including:
- Order details
- Product list with quantities and prices
- Customer information
- Shipping address
- Payment details

## Enhanced API Responses

### Order History (`GET /api/orders/`)
Now includes:
- Complete product information with images
- Dynamic payment status
- Full shipping address
- Expected delivery date
- Tracking status

### Order Details (`GET /api/orders/{order_id}/`)
Enhanced with:
- Product brand and title information
- Proper image URLs
- Complete address details
- Dynamic payment status
- Expected delivery calculation

### Order Cancellation (`POST /api/orders/{order_id}/cancel/`)
Improved response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Order cancelled successfully. Refund will be processed within 5-7 business days.",
  "order_id": "ORD123456789",
  "refund_amount": 1500.00
}
```

## Database Changes

### Automatic Fields Set
- `estimated_delivery`: Automatically set to 5 days from order creation
- `delivery_partner`: Set to "Bazar Express" by default
- `tracking_status`: Properly updated based on payment method

## Payment Status Logic

### Cash on Delivery (COD)
- Status: `pending` → `paid` (when delivered)
- Method: `COD`

### Online Payment (Razorpay)
- Status: `pending` → `paid` (when payment verified)
- Method: `RAZORPAY`

## Error Handling

All APIs now include comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages.

## Testing

Test the following scenarios:
1. Create order with COD - check payment status is `pending`
2. Create order with Razorpay - verify payment status updates to `paid`
3. Check order history - verify all product images and details show
4. Cancel order - test different order statuses
5. Download invoice - verify all details are included
6. Check expected delivery dates are calculated correctly

## Frontend Integration

The frontend should now receive:
- Correct product images and names
- Dynamic payment status
- Complete shipping addresses
- Expected delivery dates
- Proper order cancellation responses
- Invoice download functionality
