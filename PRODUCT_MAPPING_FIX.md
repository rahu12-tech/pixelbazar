# Product Mapping & GST Invoice Fix

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Product Mapping Issue**
- **Problem**: Order showing "vivo" when "oppo" was ordered
- **Root Cause**: Frontend sending wrong product ID or backend not mapping correctly
- **Database Products**:
  - ID: 1 → Name: "vivo", Title: "vivoy12"
  - ID: 2 → Name: "oppo", Title: "ghjk"

### 2. **GST & Invoice Details Missing**
- **Problem**: Invoice missing GST breakdown and complete details
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive GST calculations (18% for electronics)

## New API Endpoints

### 1. Debug Products API
```
GET /api/debug/products/
```
Returns all products with IDs for debugging mapping issues.

### 2. Payment Success Details API
```
GET /api/orders/{order_id}/success/
```
Returns complete order details with GST breakdown for payment success page.

### 3. Enhanced Invoice API
```
GET /api/orders/{order_id}/invoice/
```
Now includes complete GST breakdown and company details.

## Product Mapping Fix

### Enhanced Product Lookup
```python
# First try by ID
if product_id:
    product = Product.objects.get(id=product_id)

# If not found, try by name
if not product and product_name:
    product = Product.objects.filter(product_name__icontains=product_name).first()

# Log error if still not found
if not product:
    print(f"ERROR: Could not find product with ID {product_id} or name {product_name}")
```

## Frontend Integration

### Debug Product Mapping

2. Ensure frontend sends correct product ID when creating orders
3. Verify product mapping in order responses

### Payment Success Page

2. Display complete GST breakdown
3. Show all order details with correct product information

### Invoice Download
1. Call `GET /api/orders/{order_id}/invoice/` 
2. Parse JSON response to display/download invoice
3. Include all GST details and company information
